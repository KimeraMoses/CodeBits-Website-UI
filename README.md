# Features
> Mobie Responsiveness
 We had a task of making sure that the web pages are made responsive on different device widths

> Semantic tags 
 Use of the know semantic tags was also a checkpoint during the project, making sure that we used only tags that were neccessary.

> Beautiful UI and UX âœ¨
 Bringing out the webpages as they appear in the mockup was the major goal of this task.
